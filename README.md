# CMS L1Trigger Log Writing tool
This is my quick utility to make writing logs for CMS L1T Shifts a little more organized and easier
The keys on the right add events to the log, which can be edited
Saved events can be re-edited, or deleted
`q` or `Q` will quit the utility, and `Write Log` will dump the formatted events into a text file
